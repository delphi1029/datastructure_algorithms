 #### Applications of BFS - 
 
 1) Shortest path in un weighted graph.
 2) Crawler in search engine.
 3) Peer to Peer networks
 4) Social networking search
 5) In garbage collection (Cheney's algo)
 6) Cycle detection
 7) Ford fulkerson algorithm (The Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network).
 8) Broadcasting
